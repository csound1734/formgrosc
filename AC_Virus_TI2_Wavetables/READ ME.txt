I hope you enjoy the wavetables, I'm constantly creating free resources for Serum and other synthesizers

from the Access Virus TI. There's 99 wavetables, all of which are untouched by plugins and recorded

directly from the Virus. They all have the same names as in the Virus TI. If you have questions or

requests for resources from it, let me know.
